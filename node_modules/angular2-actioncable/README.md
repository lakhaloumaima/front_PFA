Simple and flexible integration for ActionCable and Angular applications.

## Install

```bash
npm install angular2-actioncable
```
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-v6.0.2-blue.svg)](https://nodei.co/npm/angular2-actioncable/)

If using an Angular version prior to 6:
```bash
npm install angular2-actioncable@1.2.2
```

## Usage

Use the ActionCableService to create an ActionCable consumer and subscribe to a channel.

```typescript
import { Component, OnDestroy, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Subscription } from 'rxjs';
import { ActionCableService, Channel } from 'angular2-actioncable';
import { MessageService } from './shared/messages/message.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  subscription: Subscription;

  constructor(
    private cableService: ActionCableService,
    private messageService: MessageService
  ) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    // Open a connection and obtain a reference to the channel
    const channel: Channel = this.cableService
      .cable('ws://cable.example.com')
      .channel('ChatChannel', {room : 'Best Room'});

    // Subscribe to incoming messages
    this.subscription = channel.received().subscribe(message => {
        this.messageService.notify(message);
    });
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    // Unsubscribing from the messages Observable automatically
    // unsubscribes from the ActionCable channel as well
    this.subscription.unsubscribe();
  }
}
```

## API

### ActionCableService
#### ``.cable(url: string, params?: any): Cable``
  Open a new ActionCable connection to the url. Any number of connections can be created.  
  If a function is supplied for the URL params, it will be reevaluated before any reconnection attempts.
####

#### ``.disconnect(url: string): void``
  Close an open connection for the url.
####

### Cable
#### ``.channel(name: string, params?: any): Channel``
  Create a new subscription to a channel, optionally with topic parameters.
####

#### ``.disconnect(): void``
  Close the connection.
####

#### ``.disconnected(): Observable<any>``
  Emits when the WebSocket connection is closed.
####

### Channel
#### ``.received(): Observable<any>``
  Emits messages that have been broadcast to the channel.  
  For easy clean-up, when this Observable is completed the ActionCable channel will also be closed.
####

#### ``.send(data: any): void``
  Broadcast message to other clients subscribed to this channel.
####

#### ``.perform(action: string, data?: any): void``
  Perform a channel action with the optional data passed as an attribute.
####

#### ``.initialized(): Observable<any>``
  Emits when the subscription is initialized.
####

#### ``.connected(): Observable<any>``
  Emits when the subscription is ready for use on the server.
####

#### ``.disconnected(): Observable<any>``
  Emits when the WebSocket connection is closed.
####

#### ``.rejected(): Observable<any>``
   Emits when the subscription is rejected by the server.
####

#### ``.unsubscribe(): void``
  Unsubscribe from the channel.
####

## Known Issues

* If using rxjs 6.3.3 or above, unsubscribing from the `received` Observable will **not** automatically
unsubscribe from the ActionCable channel. You can try using version 6.0.1 of this plugin, which uses rxjs 6.4.0,
but there are still issues with unsubscribe not being called if you combine the received Observable with another.
This can potentially result in memory leaks.
